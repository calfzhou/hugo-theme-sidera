# hugo-theme-sidera
Sidera — A Hugo theme for blogs, notebooks, and connected knowledge. Inspired by Stellar.


## Development status

The initial implementation is the verified Hugo collection proof from
[sidera-showcase](https://github.com/calfzhou/sidera-showcase). Its article,
collection, hierarchical-tag and pagination rendering is intentionally minimal;
Stellar-inspired visual development has not started. This is an independent
project, not an official Stellar port.

## Use and develop

The showcase consumes this repository as a Git submodule at `themes/sidera` and
sets `theme = 'sidera'`. Clone the showcase with `--recurse-submodules`, or run
`git submodule update --init --recursive` in an existing checkout.

For theme development, switch this nested checkout to `main` or a feature branch
before committing. Edit here and build the parent showcase: Hugo reads local
changes without a commit or push. Commit the theme first, then the showcase's
submodule pointer. Push the theme commit before pushing a showcase pointer that
references it. Submodule updates may detach HEAD; they do not replace normal
branch management. The `main` branch hint does not change the showcase's pinned
commit during an ordinary submodule update.

Templates live in `layouts/`; `content/_content.gotmpl` generates notebook tag
sections through Hugo's native theme content mount. Site content, collection
settings, date/permalink policy and pagination configuration remain site-owned.
No Go module, symlink, sibling checkout, or site-local implementation is required.
See the showcase README for the tested content/configuration contract and checks.

The current adapter reads local site `content/` TOML/YAML Markdown metadata.
Fresh successful builds into new destinations remain the verified workflow;
known incremental/publication limitations are not repaired by this packaging.
Drafts must still use valid metadata. Broader content-loader support and final
production compatibility are not claimed.
